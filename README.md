# <Module-1-Challenge>

## Description

This was an 'on-the-job' type scenario where a started code has been provided that needed to be corrected. There were many semantics issues within the provided HTML code. This was to be fixed to solve some accessibility issues. These semantics were then corrected to make the webpage semantically correct. There were redundancies within the CSS code that were able to be consolidated into more appropriate rulesets. In this project I was able to reinforce my knowledge of semantics and epand my experience with CSS and HTML code.
